amount = 17

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#The variable above describes an amount of money measured in
#dollars. Imagine you want to select the bills (1-dollar bills,
#5-dollar bills, 10-dollar bills, etc.) that make up that
#amount of money. For example, 17 dollars is one $10, one $5,
#and two $1s.
#
#Write a program that will print out the bills needed to
#arrive at the amount shown above. Assume that we always want
#the maximum number of large bills: for example, for 17 dollars,
#we want one $10, one $5, and two $1s, not three $5s and two $1s.
#You may assume that the largest bill you have on hand is a
#$50-dollar bill.
#
#Your code should print the following (with the correct numbers
#based on the value of amount):
#
#Fifties: 0
#Twenties: 0
#Tens: 1
#Fives: 1
#Ones: 2


#Add your code here!
Fifties = int(amount / 50)
Twenties = int((amount - Fifties) / 20)
Tens = int((amount - Twenties) / 10)
Fives = int(((amount - Tens) % 10) / 5)
Ones = int((((amount) % 10) % 5) / 1)

# print out the results as requested by the exercise
print("Fifties:", Fifties)
print("Twenties:", Twenties)
print("Tens:", Tens)
print("Fives:", Fives)
print("Ones:", Ones)
